    <h1>Learn About my Greatness</h1>
    <div id="about">
      I am a girl. I live in New York. I will enter the 12th grade in the fall. I do not look forward to applying to colleges. I am very <b>gay</b>. I am hispanic. Both of my parents immigrated from Honduras. I am of Honduran descent. Yes, I do live with <b>both of my parents</b>. My father is very much present in my life. So is my mother. I live with my parents and my younger sister. My brother moved out (thank god). Sadly, I do not have my own room. I have to share it with my sister.
